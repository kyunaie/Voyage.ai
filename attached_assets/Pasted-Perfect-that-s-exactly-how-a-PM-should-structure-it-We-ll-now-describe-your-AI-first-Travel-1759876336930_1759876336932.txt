## 🧪 User Story Example

> Abhishek logs in. The app recognizes he recently searched for “Rishikesh”.
> On the AI Recommendations page, he sees cards for *Varkala*, *Bir Billing*, and *Coorg* — with a note:
> “Because you loved nature escapes and budget-friendly trips.”
> He likes *Coorg* → next feed learns and shows *Chikmagalur* next time.
