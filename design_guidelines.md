# AI-Powered Travel Recommendation MVP - Design Guidelines

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based Approach**: Drawing inspiration from Airbnb's aspirational travel aesthetic, Pinterest's discovery patterns, and Booking.com's trustworthy UI. This creates a visually rich, engagement-focused experience where AI recommendations feel personalized and exciting.

**Core Principle**: Make AI visible and human - the interface should feel intelligent yet approachable, with visual hierarchy that guides users through discovery to booking.
